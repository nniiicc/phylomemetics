	<meta name="DC.Description" xml:lang="en" content="News is increasingly being produced and consumed online, supplanting print and broadcast to represent nearly half of the news monitored across the world today by Western intelligence agencies. Recent literature has suggested that computational analysis of large text archives can yield novel insights to the functioning of society, including predicting future economic events. Applying tone and geographic analysis to a 30&amp;ndash;year worldwide news archive, global news tone is found to have forecasted the revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, including the removal of Egyptian President Mubarak, predicted the stability of Saudi Arabia (at least through May 2011), estimated Osama Bin Laden&amp;rsquo;s likely hiding place as a 200&amp;ndash;kilometer radius in Northern Pakistan that includes Abbotabad, and offered a new look at the world&amp;rsquo;s cultural affiliations. Along the way, common assertions about the news, such as &amp;ldquo;news is becoming more negative&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;American news portrays a U.S.&amp;ndash;centric view of the world&amp;rdquo; are found to have merit.">

 is increasingly being produced and consumed online, supplanting print

suggested that computational analysis of large text archives can yield 
novel insights to the functioning of society, including predicting 
future economic events. Applying tone and geographic analysis to a 
30–year worldwide news archive, global news tone is found to have 
forecasted the revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, including the 
removal of Egyptian President Mubarak, predicted the stability of Saudi 
Arabia (at least through May 2011), estimated Osama Bin Laden’s likely 
hiding place as a 200–kilometer radius in Northern Pakistan that 
includes Abbotabad, and offered a new look at the world’s cultural 
affiliations. Along the way, common assertions about the news, such as 
“news is becoming more negative” and “American news portrays a 
U.S.–centric view of the world” are found to have merit.</p>

<p><strong><a name="p1"></a>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>The emerging field of “Culturomics” seeks to explore broad cultural 
trends through the computerized analysis of vast digital book archives, 
offering novel insights into the functioning of human society (Michel, <em>et al.</em>,
 2011). Yet, books represent the “digested history” of humanity, written
 with the benefit of hindsight. People take action based on the 
imperfect information available to them at the time, and the news media 
captures a snapshot of the real–time public information environment 
(Stierholz, 2008). News contains far more than just factual details: an 
array of cultural and contextual influences strongly impact how events 
are framed for an outlet’s audience, offering a window into national 
consciousness (Gerbner and Marvanyi, 1977). A growing body of work has 
shown that measuring the “tone” of this real–time consciousness can 
accurately forecast many broad social behaviors, ranging from box office
 sales (Mishne and Glance, 2006) to the stock market itself (Bollen, <em>et al.</em>, 2011).</p>

<p>Can the public tone of global news data forecast even broader 
behaviors, such as the stability of nations, the location of terrorist 
leaders, or even offer new insight on conflict and cooperation among 
countries, as accurately as it predicts movie sales or stock movements? 
This study makes use of a 30–year translated archive of news reports 
from nearly every country of the world, applying a range of 
computational content analysis approaches including tone mining, 
geocoding, and network analysis, to present “Culturomics 2.0.” The 
traditional Culturomics approach treats every word or phrase as a 
generic object with no associated meaning and measures only the change 
in the frequency of its usage over time. The Culturomics 2.0 approach 
introduced in this paper focuses on extending this model by imbuing the 
system with higher–level knowledge about each word, specifically 
focusing on “news tone” and geographic location, given their importance 
to the understanding of news coverage. Translating textual geographic 
references into mappable coordinates and quantifying the latent “tone” 
of news into computable numeric data permits an entirely new class of 
research questions to be explored via the news media not possible 
through the traditional frequency count approach.</p>

<p>This study will explore how the latent tone of a large digital news 
archive can be visualized to understand macro–level changes in global 
society in both time and space. Measuring the tone of news coverage 
about a single geography over time, a fundamentally new approach to 
conflict early warning is developed that “passively crowdsources” the 
global mood about each country in the world. This is found to offer 
highly accurate short–term forecasts of national stability. Focusing on 
the spatial dimension and moving from the country to the city level, the
 geographic framing of the news is found to offer significant insights 
into both nationalistic views of the world and the way in which cultures
 and “civilizations” are portrayed by the media. Finally, mapping the 
geographies most closely associated with Osama bin Laden by the news 
media prior to his capture is found to fairly accurately pinpoint his 
actual location. Global news media tone that is temporally and spatially
 aware is found to offer an intriguing new approach to modeling the 
behavior of global society itself.</p>

<p><strong><a name="p2"></a>Data sources</strong></p>

<p>Capturing the global news discourse and accurately measuring the 
local press tenor in nearly every country of the world requires a data 
source that continuously monitors domestic print, Internet, and 
broadcast media worldwide in their vernacular languages and delivers it 
as a uniform daily translated compilation. Global news databases like 
NewsBank’s Access World News emphasize English–language “international” 
editions of foreign media, intended for a foreign audience, while 
traditional news aggregators like LexisNexis do not include substantial 
non–U.S. content. Both cover only print media, while broadcast forms one
 of the primary news sources in many regions of the world, such as the 
Middle East (Howard, 2010). Even international newswires like Reuters 
include limited coverage of many regions (the entire continent of Africa
 represents just five percent of Reuters World Service) (Thomson 
Reuters, 2011) and do so through the eyes of Western–trained reporters 
framing events for their Western audiences.</p>

<p>Recognizing the need for on–the–ground insights into the reaction of 
local media around the world in the leadup to World War II, the U.S. and
 British intelligence communities formed the <em>Foreign Broadcast Information Service</em> (<em>FBIS</em> — now the Open Source Center) and <em>Summary of World Broadcasts</em> (<em>SWB</em>)
 global news monitoring services, respectively. Tasked with monitoring 
how media coverage “varied between countries, as well as from one show 
to another within the same country ... the way in which specific 
incidents were reported ... [and] attitudes toward various countries,” 
(Princeton University Library, 1998) the services transcribe and 
translate a sample of all news globally each day. The services work 
together to capture the “full text and summaries of newspaper articles, 
conference proceedings, television and radio broadcasts, periodicals, 
and non–classified technical reports” in their native languages in over 
130 countries (<em>World News Connection</em>, 2009) and were 
responsible for more than 80 percent of actionable intelligence about 
the Soviet Union during the Cold War (Studeman, 1993). In fact, news 
monitoring, or “open source intelligence,” now forms such a critical 
component of the intelligence apparatus that a 2001 <em>Washington Post</em>
 article noted “so much of what the CIA learns is collected from 
newspaper clippings that the director of the agency ought to be called 
the Pastemaster General.” (Pruden, 2001)</p>

<p>While products of the intelligence community, <em>FBIS</em> and <em>SWB</em>
 are largely strategic resources, maintaining even monitoring coverage 
across the world, rather than responding to hotspots of interest to the 
U.S. or U.K. (Leetaru, 2010). A unique iterative translation process 
emphasizes preserving the minute nuances of vernacular content, 
capturing the subtleties of domestic reaction. More than 32,000 sources 
are listed as monitored, but the actual number is likely far lower, as 
the editors draw a distinction between different editions of the same 
source. Today, both services are available to the general public, but <em>FBIS</em> is only available in digital form back to 1993, while <em>SWB</em>
 extends back more than three decades to 1979, and so is the focus of 
this study. During the January 1979 to July 2010 sample used in this 
study, <em>SWB</em> contained 3.9 million articles. The only country not covered by <em>SWB</em> is the United States, due to legal restrictions of its partner, the CIA, on monitoring domestic press.</p>

<p><em>Internet–based news</em></p>

<p>The mandate of the open source intelligence community is to follow 
news where it is produced and consumed, and while broadcast and print 
have dominated the majority of <em>SWB’s</em> 70–year history, the global growth of Web–based news has not been lost on it. As <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>
 shows, over the last 15 years Internet–based news has displaced print 
and broadcast to represent 46 percent of all content monitored globally 
by the service last year. Many of these are traditional print and 
broadcast outlets that are simply monitored online now, while numerous 
new outlets have sprung up in Web–only format across the world. The open
 source intelligence community has thus increasingly transitioned from a
 print and broadcast monitoring service to a Web crawling and 
translation service.</p>

<p>Not all news outlets are available online, especially in regions with lower Internet penetration, and by using <em>SWB</em>
 as the primary data source for this study, translated Web–based news is
 supplemented with print and broadcast news. Through its combination of 
print, broadcast, and now Internet news, <em>SWB</em> offers a 
continuous 30–year view into the global media system and its evolution. 
Such a multi–decade longitudinal dataset is critical to being able to 
place contemporary developments into perspective: if a country’s tone 
suddenly becomes sharply more negative, is that a major development, or 
when looking back over 30 years is it merely a regular seasonal change 
in tone?</p>

<p><em>Comparison sources</em></p>

<p>To ensure that the results of this paper are not merely artifacts of the <em>Summary of World Broadcast</em>
 collection and to explore the way in which news collections themselves 
can yield highly disparate world views, two comparison datasets are 
used: the complete full text of the <em>New York Times</em> 1945–2005, 
and an archive of global English–language Web–based news content 
2006–present. The full text of all 5.9 million news articles published 
in the <em>New York Times</em> from 1 January 1945 to 31 December 2005, 
totaling 2.9 billion words, offers the complete population of the paper 
of record of the United States. While the <em>Times</em> itself is a 
sampling of global news considered by its editors to be of interest to 
an American audience, having the complete population of its reporting 
allows a comparison with <em>SWB’s</em> sampled news archive. The digitized <em>Times</em>
 compilation used here ends with 31 December 2005, preventing its 
application to more recent conflicts, so a manual process was used to 
update the archive with all articles mentioning Egypt or Cairo from 1 
January 2006 through 31 May 2011.</p>

<p>A web crawl of English–language Web–based news sites from across the 
world is used as a proxy for English Web–only news to test how much 
additional insight is gained through <em>SWB’s</em> ability to penetrate
 non–Web broadcast and print media and translate vernacular languages. 
The crawl includes roughly 10,000–100,000 articles per day from 1 
January 2006 through 31 May 2011, and includes all URLs indexed by 
Google News’ front page, main topic pages, and individual country feeds 
(using its “location:” functionality).</p>

<p><em>Social media and other news alternatives</em></p>

<p>Egypt would seem the ideal test case to explore social media content,
 having the highest penetration of social media of any Middle Eastern or
 North African country, with more than five million Facebook users. In 
the weeks prior to the street protests, social media played a critical 
organizing role, helping to overcoming information asymmetry in letting 
protesters know there were others willing to take to the streets 
(Kirkpatrick, 2011). However, recognizing the power of social media, the
 government took strong steps to wrest control of the social media 
discourse, limiting Internet access, posting statements of support for 
the regime, falsely announcing that protests had been canceled and 
trying to obtain information about protesters (Preston, <em>et al.</em>, 2011).</p>

<p>Social media appears to have played more of an organizing role, with 
the traditional state–controlled news media having a far greater effect 
in guiding broader public opinion towards the protests. One of the first
 sites secured by the Army when it entered Cairo was the state 
television headquarters, and TV programming focused on the lawlessness 
caused by the protests while highlighting the steps the government was 
taking to restore peace (Fahim, 2011). Indeed, state television’s 
coverage of the protests, depicting them as “foreign and violent” or 
ignoring them altogether, isolated the protesters and helped the regime 
regain its balance in the early days of the protests (Fahim, <em>et al.</em>,
 2011). Organizers later conceded that relying on social media alone to 
get their message out, even in a country as wired as Egypt, was not 
enough and traditional mainstream news media remains the dominate force 
in driving public opinion in that country (Fahim, <em>et al.</em>, 2011).</p>

<p>Citizen media also presents many unique challenges to computational 
analysis. While some platforms like Twitter do provide programmer 
interfaces to their content, and blogs are available through several 
blog aggregators with RSS feeds, other platforms like Facebook actively 
prevent crawling even for academic study (Warden, 2010). In addition, 
social media and other localized indicators tend to be in vernacular 
languages, making use of localized slang or idiomatic expressions, 
requiring significant translation effort. Social media also show strong 
geographic disparity, with Twitter users in California and New York 
producing more content per capita than anywhere else in the United 
States or even Europe (Signorini, <em>et al.</em>, 2011), while 
questions have been raised as to whether Twitter captures world events 
as well as it does entertainment and cultural news (Taylor, 2011).</p>

<p>Search engine trends have also been used to estimate on–the–ground 
interest in a topic by a specific population. A 2011 study measured 
Arabic–language searches of Egyptians for several political parties, 
attempting to gauge which party was attracting the greatest interest 
(Koehler–Derrick and Goldstein, 2011). Yet, Internet penetration varies 
by country and some governments actively block searches on key topics. 
In addition, previous studies have suggested search behavior may in fact
 be driven more strongly by news attention than interest cycles (Cooper,
 <em>et al.</em>, 2005).</p>

<p>Given its importance as an early organizing tool, social media may 
provide an important complement to traditional news content as an early 
precursor of citizen unrest, but the technical and linguistic 
complexities, especially the need to operate on large numbers of 
vernacular languages across the world, made it beyond the scope of this 
study. Yet, as the next section illustrates, monitoring mainstream media
 alone yields a strong picture of Egypt’s social–media–driven 
revolution, suggesting mainstream media has not necessarily been fully 
supplanted as a pulse of global views on the world.</p>

<p><strong><a name="p3"></a>Method</strong></p>

<p>The complete run of all three news sources were subjected to two key 
text mining techniques: sentiment mining (Hu and Liu, 2004) and 
full–text geocoding (Goldberg, <em>et al.</em>, 2007). Sentiment mining 
counts up the number of words in a document that appear in precompiled 
dictionaries of “positive” and “negative” words to determine the density
 of emotional language and its overall “tone.” A document with many 
words like “terrible”, “awful”, and “horrific”, and few words like 
“good” or “nice” would be given a highly negative score by the 
algorithm, while one with more positive language would be given a more 
positive score. While not as accurate as humans, automated sentiment 
mining systems are robust enough that they are now used by most large 
companies to monitor the online discourse about their products and learn
 which areas consumers like and dislike.</p>

<p>It is important to note that computer–based tone scores capture only 
the overall language used in a news article, which is a combination of 
both factual events and their framing by the reporter. A classic example
 of this is a college football game: the hometown papers of both teams 
will report the same facts about the game, but the winning team’s paper 
will likely cast the game as a positive outcome, while the losing team’s
 paper will have a more negative take on the game, yielding insight into
 their respective views towards it. Capturing the global reaction to a 
political event requires precisely this type of composite tonal measure 
that emphasizes the editorial framing of the event‘s significance and 
tone.</p>

<p>Given the growing popularity of computerized content analysis, there 
are numerous manually–compiled lists of words grouped into categories 
capturing specific dimensions of text, such as the degree of anxiety 
shown by the writer or the level of authoritative language. A 
cross–section of openly available dictionaries, covering more than 1,500
 categories, was tested before settling on tone as the most reliable 
metric of conflict. Categories tested included the Regressive Imagery 
Dictionary (Martindale, 1975), WordStat’s version of WordNet 2.0 
(Provalis Research, 2005) and the 1911 <em>Roget Thesaurus</em> (Provalis Research, 2003), both the H4 and Lasswell General Inquirer dictionaries (Stone, <em>et al.</em>,
 1966), the Body Type Dictionary (Wilson, 2006), and the Forest Value 
Dictionary (Bengston and Xu, 1995). Graphs of the density of each 
category in news coverage of Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Serbia were 
examined to look for movement around the periods of major conflict. 
While some measures showed strong movement for one or two of the four 
test countries, only tone consistently showed change during periods of 
conflict. This is in keeping with previous work showing that the vast 
majority of available text categories show little consistent predictive 
power (Bollen, <em>et al.</em>, 2011).</p>

<p>Finally, full–text geocoding attempts to identify, disambiguate, and 
convert textual geographic references to geographic coordinates. A 
geocoder searches a document for mentions of locations such as “Cairo” 
and uses the surrounding context to estimate which of the 39 locations 
on earth named Cairo the given reference likely refers to. Ultimately 
the word “Cairo” is converted to an approximate latitude and longitude 
coordinate. Converting a collection of textual documents to geographic 
coordinates that can be mapped, such tools allow the geographic focus of
 an archive to be explored. Both the sentiment mining and full–text 
geocoder algorithms used in this paper were adapted from the Carbon 
Capture Report (<a href="http://www.carboncapturereport.org/">http://www.carboncapturereport.org/</a>) project.</p>

<p>From the founding of <em>FBIS</em> and <em>SWB</em> in the leadup to 
World War II, one of their primary tasks was to analyze the tone of 
domestic radio broadcasts around the world to determine their posture 
towards the West. The very first analysis report by <em>SWB’s</em> partner service <em>FBIS</em>
 was dated 6 December 1941, noting that Japanese radio had dropped its 
appeals for peace and had increased its criticism of the United States. 
The Japanese struck Pearl Harbor the following morning. While news 
monitoring will never perfectly predict the precise details of conflict,
 it can offer critical advanced warning that the posture of a country 
has changed. Knowing that the Japanese had dropped their appeals for 
peace and ramped up their attacks on the United States did not itself 
portend imminent war, but could have provided critical insight to 
military planners that there was an increased likelihood of possible 
conflict.</p>

<p>Recognizing the ability of the news to offer crucial predictive 
insights into conflict, the U.S. government has funded “conflict early 
warning” research for more than 40 years. The majority of such projects 
utilize broad annual indicators such as average educational attainment 
or GDP, or rely on “event databases” where news reports of violence are 
converted to database entries recording the date, location, and number 
involved (O’Brien, 2010). However, annual indicators can be misleading, 
as Egypt’s GDP had been increasingly steadily in recent years, while 
event databases record physical manifestations of violence, such as 
riots, meaning by the time they warn of a surge in violence, that 
country is already in the midst of conflict. Indeed, the outcomes of 
existing work have been extremely poor. Several popular models of civil 
war have been shown to miss 90 percent of the cases they were designed 
to describe, with one model correctly predicting 0 of 107 wars it 
supposedly explained (Ward, <em>et al.</em>, 2010).</p>

<p><em>FBIS</em> and <em>SWB</em> were founded on a qualitative 
humanities approach to analysis, rather than these modern quantitative 
political science methods. As the quote which opens this section shows, 
the linguistic narrative of the news media provides a rich backdrop of 
tone and latent clues to global views on an event or country. Leveraging
 automated techniques like sentiment mining, is it possible to use the 
tonal information of the news to more accurately forecast potential 
conflict around the world? In particular, by “passively crowdsourcing” 
the global tone of all coverage discussing a country, does this tone 
offer insight into future conflict outbreak in that county?</p>

<p><em>Egypt</em></p>

<p>On 25 January 2011, popular dissent with the Egyptian state 
culminated in mass protests that continued through President Mubarak’s 
resignation on 11 February. <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> shows the average tone by month from January 1979 to March 2011 of all 52,438 articles captured by <em>SWB</em>
 mentioning an Egyptian city anywhere in the article. Only articles 
explicitly mentioning an Egyptian city were included to filter out 
casual references to Egypt to return only articles reporting on the 
country in more detail. To normalize the data, the Y axis reports the 
number of standard deviations from the mean, with higher numbers 
indicating greater positivity and lower numbers indicating greater 
negativity. January 2011 reports only the tone for 1 January through 24 
January, capturing the period immediately preceding the protests. Only 
twice in the last 30 years has the global tone about Egypt dropped more 
than three standard deviations below average: January 1991 (the U.S. 
aerial bombardment of Iraqi troops in Kuwait) and 1–24 January 2011, 
ahead of the mass uprising. The only other period of sharp negative 
moment was March 2003, the launch of the U.S. invasion of neighboring 
Iraq.</p>

<p>January was a tumulteous month for Egypt, with the Tunisian 
revolution having occurred just weeks prior and a devastating bombing of
 a Coptic Christian church in Alexandria on New Year’s Eve that killed 
21 and injured 70. This domestic terrorism attack stoked anger at the 
government, which had long justified its limits on personal freedoms 
with enhanced domestic security. Indeed, one local editorial went as far
 as to call the bombing the result of “betrayal, negligence, and lack of
 concern on the part of the government” and that the attack was directed
 “against the State” rather than Christians, with Egypt becoming a 
“State without law.” (Al–Badi and Sha’ban, 2011) Global media coverage 
captured this progression towards negativity, recording in particular 
the massive outpouring of international condemnation of the church 
bombing and public views of other countries on how the bombing, coming 
on the heels of the Tunisian revolution, could destabilize Egypt.</p>

<p>Monitoring these qualitiative aspects of news coverage provides 
substantial benefits over the traditional quantitative political science
 event database approach. An event database can only capture that a 
bombing took place, but a church bombing in one country might result 
only in condemnations, while in another it might push it over the edge 
to revolt. Measuring the global news tone essentially conducts a passive
 “poll” of the press across the world, summarizing their combined views 
on the likely outcome of the event, recording whether a bombing results 
in only a few isolated factual reports, or widespread extreme 
negativity.</p>

<p>Despite being hailed as a social media revolution, monitoring the 
tone of only mainstream media around the world would have been enough to
 suggest the potential for unrest in Egypt. While such a surge in 
negativity about Egypt would not have automatically indicated that the 
government would be overthrown,  it would at the very least have 
suggested to policy–makers and intelligence analysts that there was 
increased potential for unrest. As for the likely impact on the 
government, <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> lends additional insight, 
tracing the average monthly tone of all 13,061 stories mentioning 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during the same time period. The weeks 
preceeding the protests contained the most negative discourse of his 
nearly 30–year rule. Combined with the graph of tone towards Egypt, this
 would have suggested to a policy–maker at the time that there could be 
an increased possibility of unrest in Egypt, possibly even affecting its
 previously untouchable head of state.</p>

<p><em>Comparing data sources and methods</em></p>

<p>To verify that these results are not merely artifacts of the <em>SWB</em> data collection process, <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> shows the average tone by month of <em>Summary of World Broadcasts</em> Egyptian coverage plotted against the coverage of the <em>New York Times</em> (16,106 Egyptian articles) and the English–language Web–only news (1,598,056 Egyptian articles) comparison datasets. <em>SWB</em> has a Pearson correlation of <em>r</em>=0.48 (n=63) with the Web news and <em>r</em>=0.29 (n=63) with the <em>New York Times</em>,
 suggesting a statistically significant relationship between the three. 
All three show the same general pattern of tone towards Egypt, but <em>SWB</em> tone leads Web tone by one month in several regions of the graph, which in turn leads <em>Times</em> tone. All three show a sharp shift towards negativity 1–24 January 2011, but the <em>Times</em>, in keeping with its reputation as the Grey Lady of journalism, shows a more muted response. Yet, the fact that the <em>Times</em> shows a similar overall trend curve to <em>SWB</em> is strong evidence that <em>SWB’s</em> strategy of sampling the global press is not a primary driving force in its results, given that the <em>Times</em> was analyzed in its entirety. Given <em>SWB’s</em>
 increasing reliance on Web–based news, it is not surprising that it is 
highly correlated with the Web dataset. This is in spite of <em>SWB’s</em>
 incorporation of local translated Web content, while the Web collection
 here consists only of English–language news. The five–year time span of
 the Web collection means it is not possible to place current events in a
 historical context to determine the signficance of tonal shifts, but 
the close alignment of its tone with <em>SWB</em> suggests it may become an increasingly–competitive alternative to <em>SWB</em> in the future for some types of analysis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To verify that the findings are not artifacts of the tonal dictionary selected, the monthly average tone of <em>SWB</em>
 coverage of Egypt was recalculated using two well–known tonal 
dictionaries, the Dictionary of Affect in Language (DAL) (Sweeney and 
Whissell, 1984) and the Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW) 
(Bradley and Lang, 1999). Both dictionaries have been applied 
extensively in the literature to quantify the valiance of textual 
content, and DAL in particular has a long history of validation tests. 
DAL tone is correlated at <em>r</em>=0.66 (n=387) with the Carbon Capture Report’s tone engine, while ANEW is correlated at <em>r</em>=0.46
 (n=387). All three dictionaries exhibit the same macro–level patterns 
with the sharp surge in negativity in January 2011, but the Carbon 
Capture Report engine’s specific tuning for use on news content means it
 yields a slightly clearer picture.</p>

<p>Only articles mentioning an Egyptian city are considered for the 
average monthly tone to discard casual references to Egypt. Articles 
mentioning a city in Egypt are more likely to be about Egypt in some 
fashion than ones that mention only the name of the country. Removing 
this requirement and including all articles that mention Egypt (95,288 
articles) results in a tonal curve that is correlated at <em>r</em>=0.85
 (n=387) with the city–filtered tone, showing that the results are not 
an artifact of this filtering process. Rather, by removing noise 
articles, the resulting tonal graph shows sharper up/down movement, 
making trends clearer.</p>

<p>As discussed earlier, the <em>SWB</em> content above includes all articles monitored by <em>SWB</em> from every country in every language. Like all monitoring services, limited resources mean that <em>SWB</em>
 is unable to capture 100 percent of the daily global discourse and thus
 must select only a sample to record. Even higher population countries 
like Egypt may have months where very little coverage is captured from 
their domestic press, while smaller countries may have multiple months 
without coverage recorded in <em>SWB</em>. To examine the impact of 
this, the average tone by month was computed for only those articles 
sourced from a news outlet based in Egypt (18,978 articles), and again 
for only those articles sourced from Arabic–language outlets anywhere in
 the world (24,024 articles).</p>

<p>For the period January 1979 to March 2011, there were 50 months that 
had less than three articles from an Egyptian source mentioning an 
Egyptian city, while in 25 months there were less than three articles 
from an Arabic–language source. (Three articles a month was set as the 
cutoff below which there was too little coverage to generate meaningful 
tone averages.) There is an average of 245 articles a month from all 
sources that mention Egypt, compared with 56 articles a month from 
Egyptian sources and 66 articles a month from Arabic sources. Despite 
these limitations, the tone by month during this period of news from all
 countries is highly correlated with news from Egyptian and Arabic 
sources. Tone from Egyptian–based sources is correlated at <em>r</em>=0.63 (n=337), while Arabic–language press is correlated at <em>r</em>=0.67
 (n=362). The major difference is that both are significantly more 
muted, and have less pronounced declines in January 2011, likely a 
reflection of the sharp state media controls that exist in many 
Arabic–language countries. As noted earlier, Egypt in particular 
deployed significant resources to mute mainstream coverage of the 
unrest. Thus, basing tone about each country on a composite of all 
global coverage, rather than limiting to only coverage from a specific 
country, mitigates these issues of state media control and censorship, 
as well as ensuring a higher volume of content, especially for smaller 
countries.</p>

<p><em>Tunisia</em></p>

<p>Tunisia’s revolution set off the Arab Spring, but unlike the other 
countries examined here, there were simply too few articles in <em>SWB</em>
 mentioning specific cities in Tunisia (6,636) to perform city–level 
filtering. In addition, many months had less than 10 articles worldwide 
mentioning the country, compared with 245 a month for Egypt. For 
Tunisia, all mentions of the country, regardless of whether they 
mentioned specific cities in Tunisia, were counted, resulting in 16,856 
articles. This results in a weaker tonal profile that is less selective 
and refined than that used for the other countries. Nevertheless, the 
two–week period prior to Tunisian President Ben Ali’s resignation was 
the sixth–most negative period in the last 30 years, coming after a 
decade–long plunge towards increasing negativity.</p>

<p><em>Libya</em></p>

<p>By the time full–scale protests in Libya erupted on 15 February 2011,
 negative tone in the prior two weeks had reached levels seen only four 
times prior in the last 30 years (14,109 articles). Unlike Egypt and 
Tunisia, Libya did not show a sharp increase in negative tone in the 
weeks prior to the first isolated protests in early January and it was 
not until the beginning of February that tone reached extreme lows. This
 likely reflects the fact that protests in Libya did not gather steam 
until mid–February, and hence there was no major shift in tone until the
 situation was poised on the verge of descent into full conflict.</p>

<p><em>The Balkans</em></p>

<p>The ethnic conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s caught many by 
surprise and offer an ideal cross–check to ensure that the findings are 
not an artifact of the time period or geographic region. Serbia’s tonal 
descent began in June 1990, with a sharp and steady fall towards 
increasing negativity through March 1991, with the Karadordevo 
Agreement. Tone stayed at its most negative levels in the measurement 
period to that point through late 1993. Tone began to increase towards 
positivity beginning in July 1995, peaking with the Dayton Agreement in 
December 1995. In early 1996, tone began a sharp downward slide again. 
By early 1998, tone was at levels not seen since the first conflict. 
Indeed, this period has the highest levels of negative tone ever seen in
 Serbia over this 30–year period (96,251 articles), reflecting the 
intensity of the conflict during this period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike the Arab Spring’s focus on personal freedoms and governmental 
representation, the Balkans conflict was primarily ethnically driven. 
Similar to tone, the average density of ethnic discourse can be measured
 to determine how “ethnically charged” news coverage of a country has 
become. <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a> shows the percent of all Serbian coverage each month in <em>SWB</em>
 that included at least one reference to an ethnic group in the Balkans.
 The increasing density of ethnic discourse is strongly inversely 
correlated with tone at <em>r</em>=-0.73 (n=379), meaning that ethnic 
references increased at nearly the same rate as tone about Serbia became
 more negative, suggesting strong ethnic contextualization of the 
negativity. Rather than ethnicities, mentions of religion, social 
groups, needs such as food or water access, desire for democracy, and 
other topics can be used to similarity contextualize shifts in tone.</p>

<p><em>Saudi Arabia</em></p>

<p>A reliable forecasting technique must be accurate at predicting both 
presence and absence of the phenomena being measured. Saudi Arabia with 
31,196 articles, offers an excellent case study of a country that has 
managed to resist regime change, even as several of its geographically 
and culturally proximate neighbors have undergone revolutions. As <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>
 illustrates, there is a local trough in March 2011, where tone became 
more negative than previous, but this level had been reached repeatedly 
over the previous ten years, whereas tone for Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and
 other countries undergoing revolution reached sharply lower levels than
 previously seen. Thus, substantial tonal movement towards negativity is
 an indicator of possible unrest, while absence of such movement 
indicates greater likelihood of stability.</p>

<p><em>The world</em></p>

<p>Looking beyond the tone towards a single country, what does the tone 
of the entire world look like aggregated by month? Is the world as a 
whole becoming more negative, at least according to the news? <a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a> shows the average tone of the entire <em>New York Times</em> by month from January 1945 to December 2005. The <em>Times</em>
 exhibits a strong decade–long trend towards negativity from the early 
1960s to the early 1970s, before recovering towards slight negativity, 
and has trended slightly more negative in recent years up to the 11 
September 2001 attacks, which caused news to become sharply more 
negative in the following four years. The <em>New York Times</em> has a strong U.S. focus, however, so <a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a> shows the tone of all <em>Summary of World Broadcasts</em>
 news January 1979 to July 2010 (content after July 2010 was available 
only for articles mentioning one of the countries above), showing a 
steady, near linear, march towards negativity. For the period of 
overlap, January 1979 to December 2005, the two have a Pearson 
correlation of <em>r</em>=0.55 (n=324), suggesting that news as a whole is becoming more negative.</p>

<p><strong><a name="p5"></a>The spatial dimension of news</strong></p>

<p>Conflict early warning uses the spatial dimension of the news only as
 a filtering mechanism, honing in on city–level references to reduce 
noise. Yet, location is a critical component of the news, with a typical
 news article averaging one location mention every 200–300 words. The <em>New York Times</em>,
 with 2.9 billion total words from 1945–2005, mentions 369,000 unique 
locations more than 10.4 million times, or around one location every 279
 words. The <em>Summary of World Broadcasts</em>, with 1.2 billion words
 from 1979–2010, has 201,000 unique locations mentioned roughly 5.81 
million times, or around one geographic reference every 215 words. While
 the previous section explored news tone visualized through time, this 
section will visualize it spatially, exploring several key questions 
about journalism.</p>

<p>The maps below compare the world in 2005 according to the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>Summary of World Broadcasts</em>.
 Each city or other geographic landmark (such as islands, oceans, 
mountains, rivers, etc) is color–coded on a 400–point scale from bright 
green (high positivity) to bright red (high negativity), based on the 
average tone of all articles mentioning that city in 2005. Each article 
mentioning two or more cities together results in a link being drawn 
between those cities, and the average tone of all articles mentioning 
both cities is used to color–code that link on the same color scale as 
the cities. Alternatively, a grammatical approach could have been used, 
with data mining tools that could have teased out just the tone of each 
individual city mentioned, rather than assigning the overall document 
tone to all cities mentioned in that document. The more simplistic 
method here was chosen in order to capture geographic “framing.” In 
essence, if a city is mentioned in a positive light in highly negative 
documents over a long period of time, that city is being contextualized 
by the news media as having some relationship with the negative events, 
which this technique captures. More critically, this approach also 
captures the framed connections among cities. A typical <em>New York Times</em>
 article about a bombing in a foreign city will usually include a quote 
from the White House condemning the attack. The White House has nothing 
to do with the attack itself, but is being contextualized as an actor in
 the events as they are described to an American audience.</p>

<p>The two maps are highly divergent, with the <em>Times</em> mentioning 19,785 distinct locations on Earth in 2005 to <em>SWB’s</em> 29,592. Reflecting the <em>Times’</em> U.S. focus, 338 (1.1 percent) of the <em>SWB</em> locations and 8,045 (40.7 percent) of the <em>Times’</em>
 were in the United States. Most surprisingly, however, is that just 
3,080 locations (6.7 percent) are mentioned by both sources. A large 
portion of this difference appears to be that the <em>Times</em> assumes
 its American readership is unfamiliar with the geography of most 
foreign countries and so tends to report locations at the province level
 or as “near” major cities. <em>SWB</em> reports, coming from countries 
with ties to the countries being discussed, or from the country itself, 
tend to use a greater density of precise local city and landmark 
references. Most strikingly, however, the <em>Times</em> map shows a 
world revolving around the United States, with nearly every foreign 
location it covers being mentioned alongside a U.S. city, usually 
Washington D.C. Foreign coverage is very uneven, with Africa, Southern 
Asia, and Latin America being especially poorly represented, while 
Europe is well represented. <em>SWB</em> shows a far more balanced view 
of the world, with far better coverage of most geographic locales and no
 single set of countries dominating the connections. Clicking on the

<p><em>Mapping the world of Bin Laden</em></p>

<p>Narrowing the focus from the entire world to that of a particular 
actor, could global news have given us insights into the hiding place of
 Osama Bin Laden? The topic has attracted a fair bit of attention over 
the past decade, including a 2009 study that combined satellite imagery 
and biogeographic analysis in an attempt to pinpoint his location to 
three buildings in Pakistan (Gillespie, <em>et al.</em>, 2009). <a href="#fig14">Figure 14</a> shows all geographic references and their co–occurrence links in coverage mentioning Osama bin Laden in <em>SWB</em>
 content January 1979 through April 2011 (only “bin laden” was used as 
the search criteria to avoid the transliteration issues associated with 
his first name).</p>

<p>From his rise in the global media in the late 1990s to the month 
prior to his capture, Bin Laden has been most commonly associated with 
Pakistan and in the map below all roads appear to lead to Northern 
Pakistan. Indeed nearly 49 percent of all articles mentioning Bin Laden 
included a city in Pakistan and both Islamabad and Peshawar rank in the 
top five non–Western cities associated with him. The next four most 
closely associated countries are the United States (38 percent), Iran 
(33 percent), Afghanistan (28 percent), and the Philippines (20 
percent). The city of his capture, Abbottabad, makes only a single 
appearance in an article on 16 April 2011 regarding the arrest of a 
terror suspect in the city (Mir, 2011). However, Abbottabad is less than
 200 kilometers from both of two most popular cities associated with 
him, or roughly the radius between Islamabad and Peshawar.</p>

<p>While far from a definitive lock on Bin Laden’s location, global news
 content would have suggested Northern Pakistan in a 200 km. radius 
around Islamabad and Peshawar as his most likely location, and that he 
was nearly twice as likely to be making his residence in Pakistan as 
Afghanistan.</p>

<p><strong><a name="p6"></a>Mapping the “civilizations” of the world’s press</strong></p>

<p>Scholars have long sought to organize the world into “civilizations” 
that collect countries together by shared cultural or political 
foundations. Perhaps the most famous theory of world civilizations was 
put forth by Samuel Huntington in his controversial 1996 book entitled <em>The clash of civilizations and the remaking of world order</em>,
 where he organized the world into ten major divisions. The majority of 
data–driven civilization theories rely on demographic information such 
as ethnic group or religious affiliation distribution or economic data 
such as trade ties. Media–driven studies of the “relatedness” of 
countries have focused primarily on how often the press of one country 
covers events in another, measuring media selection bias (Wu, 2000). 
Yet, as the maps in the previous section illustrate, the global news 
media appears to cluster regions together, relating cities in one area 
to those in another more closely than to the rest of the world, offering
 an implicit grouping of “civilizations.”</p>

<p><a href="#fig15">Figure 15</a> visualizes the way in which the global
 news media frames the world for its readership and the “civilizations” 
that result. As with <a href="#fig13">Figure 13</a>, all mentions of a city or geographic landmark across <em>SWB</em>
 content 1979–2009 were pooled together, and a link established between 
each pair of cities that appear in an article together. These were then 
aggregated up to the country level, yielding a network diagram with the 
countries of the world as nodes and the edges between them recording the
 number of articles those two countries appeared together in. Many 
countries appear together in just a handful of articles out of <em>SWB’s</em>
 3.9 million from this period, and so to reduce noise, only links 
representing five percent or more of one of the two countries’ total 
appearances were retained. This discarded single isolated connections of
 a pair of countries, while retaining those that were more regularly 
discussed together in the news. To capture the intensity of news 
attention as accurately as possible, edge weights were not normalized, 
meaning that higher–volume countries that occur together frequently will
 have a stronger edge weight than those with lower coverage volumes.</p>

<p>The Louvain hierarchical modularity finding process (Blondel, <em>et al.</em>,
 2008) was then used to extract the “natural communities” of nodes 
within the network. Modularity finding organizes a network into clusters
 of nodes where the nodes within each group are more closely connected 
to each other than to the rest of the network. In the case of this news 
relatedness network, modularity finding locates groups of countries that
 are mentioned together more often with each other than with other 
countries. The resulting partition finds that the global news media, as 
captured by <em>SWB</em>, divides the world into six major civilizations, visualized spatially in <a href="#fig16">Figure 16</a>.
 Overall, these civilizations appear to closely track geographic 
proximity, which might intuitively make sense, with events in one 
country involving or being related to those in a neighboring country. 
Notable outliers include Spain, where colonial ties to South America 
appear to overcome its affinity to Europe, and France and Portugal, 
reflecting their ties to Africa. The most geographically diverse cluster
 is centered on the Middle East, but also includes Canada, Norway, and 
the United Kingdom. The smallest cluster consists of India and several 
of its immediate neighbors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most theories of civilizations feature some approximation of the degree of conflict or cooperation between each group. <a href="#fig17">Figure 17</a>
 displays the average tone of all links between cities in each 
civilization, visualizing the overall “tone” of the relationship between
 each. Group 1, which roughly encompasses the Asiatic and Australian 
regions, has largely positive links to the rest of the world and is the 
only group with a positive connection to Group 4 (Middle East). Group 3 
(Africa) has no positive links to any other civilization, while Group 2 
(North and South America excluding Canada) has negative links to all but
 Group 1. As opposed to explicit measures of conflict or cooperation 
based on armed conflict or trade ties, this approach captures the latent
 view of conflict and cooperation as portrayed by the world’s news 
media.</p>

<p><a href="#fig18">Figure 18</a> shows the world civilizations according to the <em>New York Times</em>
 1945–2005. It divides the world into five civilizations, but paints a 
very different picture of the world, with a far greater portion of the 
global landmass arrayed around the United States. Geographic affinity 
appears to play a far lesser role in this grouping, and the majority of 
the world is located in a single cluster with the United States. It is 
clear from comparing the <em>SWB</em> and <em>NYT</em> civilization maps
 that even within the news media there is no one “universal” set of 
civilizations, but that each country’s media system may portray the 
world very differently to its audience. By pooling all of these varied 
viewpoints together, <em>SWB’s</em> view of the world’s civilizations 
offers a “crowdsourced” aggregate view of civilization, but it too is 
likely subject to some innate Western bias.</p>

<p><strong><a name="p7"></a>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>Monitoring first broadcast then print media over the last 70 years, 
nearly half of the annual output of Western intelligence global news 
monitoring is now derived from Internet–based news, standing testament 
to the Web’s disruptive power as a distribution medium. Pooling together
 the global tone of all news mentions of a country over time appears to 
accurately forecast its near–term stability, including predicting the 
revolutions in Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya, conflict in Serbia, and the 
stability of Saudi Arabia. Location plays a critical role in news 
reporting, and “passively crowdsourcing” the media to find the locations
 most closely associated with Bin Laden prior to his capture finds a 
200km.–wide swath of northern Pakistan as his most likely hiding place, 
an area which contains Abbottabad, the city he was ultimately captured 
in. Finally, the geographic clustering of the news, the way in which it 
frames localities together, offers new insights into how the world views
 itself and the “natural civilizations” of the news media.</p>

<p>While heavily biased and far from complete, the news media captures 
the only cross–national real–time record of human society available to 
researchers. The findings of this study suggest that Culturomics, which 
has thus far focused on the digested history of books, can yield 
intriguing new understandings of human society when applied to the 
real–time data of news. From forecasting impending conflict to offering 
insights on the locations of wanted fugitives, applying data mining 
approaches to the vast historical archive of the news media offers 
promise of new approaches to measuring and understanding human society 
on a global scale. <img src="Culturomics%202.0_%20Forecasting%20large-scale%20human%20behavior%20using%20global%20news%20media%20tone%20in%20time%20and%20space%20%7C%20Leetaru%20%7C%20First%20Monday_files/30745.gif" alt="End of article"></p>
